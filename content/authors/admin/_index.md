William Chen is a Senior Research Analyst on the DSGE Team at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
His research focuses on the determinants of business cycles, such as the role of the financial system
in the propagation of macroeconomic shocks. He also develops new computational methods
to expand the range of problems macroeconomists can study, such as models with
heterogeneous agents and/or nonlinearities.
