abstract: We revisit a family of infinite-energy solutions of the 3D incompressible [Euler equations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/euler-equation) proposed by Gibbon et al. [9] and shown to blowup in finite time by Constantin [6]. By adding a damping term to the momentum equation we examine how the [damping coefficient](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/damping-coefficient) can arrest this blowup. Further, we show that similar infinite-energy solutions of the inviscid 3D Boussinesq system with damping can develop a singularity in finite time as long as the damping effects are insufficient to arrest the (undamped) 3D Euler blowup in the associated damped 3D Euler system.This paper illustrates the usefulness of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods in approximating DSGE model posterior distributions. We show how the tempering schedule can be chosen adaptively, explore the benefits of an SMC variant we devise termed generalized tempering for "online" estimation, and provide examples of multimodal posteriors well-captured by SMC methods. We then use our online estimation technique to compute pseudo-out-of-sample density forecasts of DSGE models with and without financial frictions, documenting the benefits of conditioning DSGE model forecasts on nowcasts of macroeconomic variables and interest rate expectations. We also study whether the predictive ability of DSGE models changes when we adopt priors substantially looser than commonly adopted in the literature.
